*diffconflicts.txt*	A better Vimdiff Git mergetool

This plugin converts a file containing Git conflict markers into a two-way diff
in Vimdiff. Additional mappings can be given to see the full three-way diff.

Configure this plugin as a mergetool in Git via the following shell commands:

git config --global merge.tool diffconflicts
git config --global mergetool.diffconflicts.cmd 'vim -c DiffConflicts "$MERGED" "$BASE" "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE"'
git config --global mergetool.diffconflicts.trustExitCode true
git config --global mergetool.keepBackup false

Commands:
:DiffConflicts
	Convert a file containing Git conflict markers into a two-way diff.

:DiffConflictsShowHistory
        Open a new tab containing the merge base and the local and remote
        version of the conflicted file.

:DiffConflictsWithHistory
	Call both DiffConflicts and DiffConflictsShowHistory. This is useful in
	the Git mergetool configuration to always open the history by default.

						*DiffConflicts-settings*
This plugin doesn't have any settings.
